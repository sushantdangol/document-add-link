# Link files to your documents

## Things to make sure of:
### 1) Make sure the folder containing the documents to link to and the file name is the same. 
### 2) Make sure that the wording inside the document to be linked to is the same as the file (including the extension).

## How to use it:
### Run in the command line `php script.php <path/to/the/document/file>`
### Please ensure that the folder is present in the same location as the file.
